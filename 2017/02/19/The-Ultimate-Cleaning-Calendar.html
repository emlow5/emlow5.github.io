<p>It was 60 degrees all weekend long, so my weekend consisted of walking the dogs, sitting outside reading and bullet journaling, and cleaning my house with the windows open. It felt like a beautiful spring day everyday, not February in Michigan. I was able to get a lot of cleaning done, so it insprired me to write about one of my favorite and most useful pages in my bullet journal, my cleaning calendar.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cleaning calendar is broken up into weekly chores and monthly chores. I&#8217;m a realistic person, so I know very well that I most likely won&#8217;t achieve all my weekly cleaning goals or monthly cleaning goals. However, having them written down and marking them when they&#8217;ve been completed, helps me to prioritize for the next week or month, what really needs to be cleaned the most!</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="http://journalsbyemily.com/images/cleanweekly.png" alt="cleanweekly.png">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are seven tasks that I attempt to do each week; sweep upstairs/stairs, sweep downstairs, sweep basement/stairs, wipe down kitchen, wipe down bathrooms, wash/switch sheets, and wash/switch towels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is what I believe <strong>I</strong> should accomplish once a week at my own home, but the great thing about bullet journals is you can customize your own cleaning calendar to work for your home and your needs.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a lot more tasks that I attempt to achieve each month, this is where marking down what&#8217;s been done comes in handy. I know I&#8217;ll never accomplish all twelve tasks every month, so this helps me prioritize! The twelve tasks I have for my house are; clean toilets, wash quilt/duvet, clean shower/tub, wipe out fridge, wipe out microwave, wash/shake rugs, mop floors, wash windows, clean oven, clean coffeemaker, dust all rooms, and dust baseboards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keeping up with my weekly cleaning schedule was a hassle, but this Christmas I got a gift from my parents that made keeping our floors clean a <em>breeze</em>. My parents bought my fiance, Matthew and I a Roomba for Christmas, and it truly changed our lives!</p>

<p>Before our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Roomba-Robotic-Vacuum-Cleaner/dp/B008LX6OC6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487560030&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=roomba">Roomba</a>, keeping our downstairs (which consists only of tile and hardwoood floors) clean was a constant struggle. I don&#8217;t want to blame everything on our corgi, Arya, but let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s her fault. Hair just falls of her consistantly, you don&#8217;t even have to pet her. It builds up in the corners of rooms and under tables and our couch. However, our roomba has helped to keep us sane and our feet clean! If you own a pet, have children, or let&#8217;s face it, just aren&#8217;t the perfect adult that takes off their shoes everytime they step into their house, then a Roomba may just change your life.</p>

<p>Another staple cleaning item in our house is Meyer&#8217;s cleaning solutions.</p>

<p>We use Meyer&#8217;s for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mrs-Meyers-Lemon-Verbena-Fluid/dp/B00ID2NLXK/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487560123&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=Meyer&amp;th=1">hand soap</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mrs-Meyers-Clean-Day-Multi-Surface/dp/B00ICIYVT8/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487560201&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Meyer">multi-surface everyday cleaner</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MEYERS-Liquid-Lemon-Verbena-Fluid/dp/B01MG2BJF0/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487560246&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Meyer">dish detergent</a>. Not only are these products free of harsh chemicals but they smell great. They make lots of different scents, but so far we&#8217;ve only used Lemon Verbana and Lavender, and they have both smelled great! Not too strong, with a fresh, clean smell.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using these products makes cleaning less of a chore, and more of an experience. Prioritizing cleaning needs  throughout the household can help you keep your house fresh and clean, and more enjoyable for everyone!</p>
