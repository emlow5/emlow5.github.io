<p>180 days from now I will officially be married to my best friend on earth! I&#8217;m naturally a very organized and detailed person, and my job as a photo stylist has made this part of my personality even more attuned to details and an overall vision, so planning a wedding has challenged me in a whole new perspective. I obviously had big plans for what I wanted for my wedding day, pinning the impossible on Pinterest day after day. However, the closer we get to the wedding date the more realistic I become with how I envision my wedding and have had to throw a lot of my crazier dreams out the window. I use my bullet journal everyday, so obviously at some point planning my wedding was going to become a large part of my bullet journal life. So far I have incorporated my wedding planning into my bullet journal in the following five easy ways.</p>

<h3 id="__1_the_countdown_page">#1 The Countdown Page</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve used countdowns in my bullet journal in the past. However, it&#8217;s difficult to be able to successfully countdown to a certain date, so far in advanced, especially if there are days you miss during the countdown! So for this countdown I put the number of days away from the date in a box in a large font once a month, and use the actual dates of the months to physically countdown with "X&#8217;s".</p>

<h3 id="__2_registry_list">#2 Registry List</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Matthew and I have almost lived together for three years, and where I work, at least once a year we are able to get free things for our home, especially the kitchen. Therefore, when it comes to a gift registry it can get a little difficult to know and remember exactly what we need for our home. I began a gift registry list, organized by category like "kitchen", "bathroom" and "bedroom". This will help me to better understand what we need to register for when we eventually start our wedding registry.</p>

<h3 id="__3_song_list_for_the_wedding_day">#3 Song List for the Wedding Day</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A large part of our wedding day is the music we choose to play for the most important and impactful parts of our special day. This is also the only thing that I can fully control and don&#8217;t have to settle on. I have a column for every part of the wedding day that would need a specific music selection of our choosing like, the "first dance", the "processional", the "recessional" and the "cake cutting".</p>

<h3 id="__4_live_pinterest_board">#4 Live Pinterest Board</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My favorite pages of my bullet journal that I have made for wedding planning, so far, is what I like to call the "Live Pinterest Board". Obviously, I pinned many different ideas on my wedding Pinterest board and after awhile everything became a little overwhelming and confusing. After deciding on a more clear overall theme and feel for our wedding day I printed all of the ideas and taped them into my bullet journal in a creative but organized manner. This also helps me to understand and remember certain things I need to buy, borrow or find for our wedding day, such as old windows that I plan on using to display our seating chart. Putting all of these picture ideas and a rough layout for our reception helps me to understand the look and feel for our wedding.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a basic wedding to-do list however it&#8217;s organized by how many months away from the wedding they need to be accomplished. I love a good to-do list, and this specific list is everything I need to ultimately do before our wedding day in 180 days! Organizing it by months from the wedding helps me to prioritize what needs to be done now and what can wait till later. I assembled this list based off lists from Pinterest, The Knot and WeddingWire.</p>
