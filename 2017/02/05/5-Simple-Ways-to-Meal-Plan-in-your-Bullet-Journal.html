<p>Meal planning is something I have always strived to be successful at, but until I understood how to completely plan it out with my bullet journal, I was not successful at all. Unfortunately in the past a lot of food waste has been done by me and my fiance Matthew. However, now with my bullet journal, I can meal plan like a pro! My next goal is meal prepping, but that&#8217;s a whole other ball game!</p>

<h3 id="__1_make_a_master_grocery_list">#1 Make a Master Grocery List</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is something I found on Pinterest, and had to do! Make a Master Grocery list with categorized lists that help you keep all of your cooking needs organized. The categories I used are; fruits, veggies, dairy, meats, canned, pantry, condiments/sauces, frozen, spices and bakery. I also made lists for easy go-to dinners and lunch/snack ideas as a reference guide for when I am making my meal plan for the week.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Doing something as simple as planning your dinners for the week, by inserting a chart in your weekly spread, can really make quite a difference. This allows you to look at your week ahead at a glance and plan accordingly.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this spread I&#8217;ve implemented the same idea as my Master Grocery List, by making a list of simple breakfast and lunch ideas, to help get an idea for grocery needs. I&#8217;ve made a chart to plan my dinners for the week ahead and also added a space for a grocery list. I try to go grocery shopping on Sundays and planning my week ahead of time helps me have a better idea of what I really need, so I can avoid as much food waste as possible.</p>

<h3 id="__4_add_a_have_and_a_need_column_next_to_your_grocery_list">#4 Add a Have and a Need Column Next to Your Grocery List</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For most people simply adding a grocery list when meal planning will be helpful enough. However, for some people, like me, especially when trying a new recipe, it makes everything much easier to write down all the ingredients and decide what you need and don&#8217;t need before going to the grocery store. You never know when you&#8217;re fiance is going to use the rest of the butter and not let you know before you go grocery shopping (am I right?!). I simply use an X to mark what I have and make a square for the things I need, and I&#8217;ll color in the squares once I buy each ingredient.</p>

<h3 id="__5_mark_your_meals_with_symbols_for_leftovers">#5 Mark Your Meals with Symbols for Leftovers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After a couple of weeks of meal planning with my bullet journal, I started being successful at having dinner ready each night. However, I noticed that many times a lot of our leftovers had gone to waste because we actually had too much food. I kept making dinner and the lunches I had planned without using our leftovers and in the end had to throw them out. So implementing a symbol for meals I have to cook and meals that will be leftovers helps me to not only not waste food but to also not waste money! For this chart I use a purple triangle for the meals I have to make and a black triangle for any meals I&#8217;m having as leftovers. I think next time I&#8217;ll use colors that will contrast more.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I hope these meal planning ideas will help you be a successful meal planner. Once you have really nailed down a system, meal planning can help you not only save money, but also help to not waste as much food and will most likely help you to eat healthier in the end!</p>
