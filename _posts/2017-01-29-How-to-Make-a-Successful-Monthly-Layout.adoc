= How to Make a Successful Monthly Layout

Welcome back everybody! This week I'm going to be discussing my monthly layout for the month of February. I typically put my calendar, habit tracker, and monthly to-do list on the same spread. However, this month I decided to change it up and make my calendar for February large enough to fill the entire spread. I want to be able to write my gratitude for each day in my calendar days on my monthly spread rather than in a list format.

My weekly spread is much different from January. I have made one page dedicated to each day, combining Saturday and Sunday into just the "Weekend". The other half of my spread has a habit tracker for only those seven days (rather than the whole month), a spending tracker, water tracker, sleep tracker, to-do list, need to buy list, a dinner planning chart, and a step tracker. Unfortunately, I messed up on step tracker and set it up for entire month, instead of just these specific seven days, like the rest of the trackers, and... I also totally messed up the dates of the first 3 days on the first page. Whoops... brain fart! 

For this month, I completely got rid of the meal tracker. I found it too obnoxious to write every single thing down that I eat, and I don't think it really encouraged me to eat any healthier than normal. However, I did include a dinner plans chart to help us plan for groceries, and keep us from eating out as often.

The last spread that I made for the month of February is my exercise log and planner. One page has a monthly calendar spread with an exercise plan for each day. I designated leg days, arm days, ab days, and specified Saturday as a stretch and yoga day. I only filled in one week to show my ultimate plan for each day and left the rest of the days blank in case I decide I need to do less or more of a specific exercise based on how hard or easy I find it. This allows me to push myself but not give myself unrealistic goals. The other page of this spread is my exercise log. Since I live in Michigan, and the weather in February is typically terrible, I'm giving myself three cardio options for each day; our indoor bike, walking the dogs, or running outside. Therefore I can keep track of my cardio and make sure it's designated to each specific exercise. This also allows me to compare distance and time for each type of cardio rather than trying to distinguish between a walk and a run, for instance. I like having the freedom of different cardio options and being able to see how I've improved or haven't improved at just a glance.

Those are my pages for the month of February. My goal for February is to try and show my love and gratitude to others more often and to focus on getting stronger and more fit. Hopefully these pages that I've set-up will help me to focus on each of my goals and keep me organized in the process. What other spreads could I set-up each month? Do you have any go-to spreads that help you stay organized every month? Leave me a comment on my instagram **@journalsbyemily** and let me know!
