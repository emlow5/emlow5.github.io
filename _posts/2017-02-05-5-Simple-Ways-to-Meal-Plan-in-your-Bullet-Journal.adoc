= 5 Simple Ways to Meal Plan in your Bullet Journal

Meal planning is something I have always strived to be successful at, but until I understood how to completely plan it out with my bullet journal, I was not successful at all. Unfortunately in the past a lot of food waste has been done by me and my fiance Matthew. However, now with my bullet journal, I can meal plan like a pro! My next goal is meal prepping, but that's a whole other ball game!

### #1 Make a Master Grocery List

This is something I found on Pinterest, and had to do! Make a Master Grocery list with categorized lists that help you keep all of your cooking needs organized. The categories I used are; fruits, veggies, dairy, meats, canned, pantry, condiments/sauces, frozen, spices and bakery. I also made lists for easy go-to dinners and lunch/snack ideas as a reference guide for when I am making my meal plan for the week.

### #2 Use a Simple Dinner Plans Chart in Your Weekly Spreads

Doing something as simple as planning your dinners for the week, by inserting a chart in your weekly spread, can really make quite a difference. This allows you to look at your week ahead at a glance and plan accordingly.

### #3 Add a Section for Your Grocery List when Meal Planning

In this spread I've implemented the same idea as my Master Grocery List, by making a list of simple breakfast and lunch ideas, to help get an idea for grocery needs. I've made a chart to plan my dinners for the week ahead and also added a space for a grocery list. I try to go grocery shopping on Sundays and planning my week ahead of time helps me have a better idea of what I really need, so I can avoid as much food waste as possible.

### #4 Add a Have and a Need Column Next to Your Grocery List

For most people simply adding a grocery list when meal planning will be helpful enough. However, for some people, like me, especially when trying a new recipe, it makes everything much easier to write down all the ingredients and decide what you need and don't need before going to the grocery store. You never know when you're fiance is going to use the rest of the butter and not let you know before you go grocery shopping (am I right?!). I simply use an X to mark what I have and make a square for the things I need, and I'll color in the squares once I buy each ingredient.

### #5 Mark Your Meals with Symbols for Leftovers

After a couple of weeks of meal planning with my bullet journal, I started being successful at having dinner ready each night. However, I noticed that many times a lot of our leftovers had gone to waste because we actually had too much food. I kept making dinner and the lunches I had planned without using our leftovers and in the end had to throw them out. So implementing a symbol for meals I have to cook and meals that will be leftovers helps me to not only not waste food but to also not waste money! For this chart I use a purple triangle for the meals I have to make and a black triangle for any meals I'm having as leftovers. I think next time I'll use colors that will contrast more.

I hope these meal planning ideas will help you be a successful meal planner. Once you have really nailed down a system, meal planning can help you not only save money, but also help to not waste as much food and will most likely help you to eat healthier in the end!
