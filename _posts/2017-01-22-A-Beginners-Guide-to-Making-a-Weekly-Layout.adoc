= A Beginner's Guide to Making a Weekly Layout

Welcome everyone! Today I'll be discussing the basics to weekly layouts in your bullet journal. Personally, my weekly pages are the most important pages to me. They keep me organized and on track with my specific goals, especially goals that I may be tracking the overall progress of on a separate page.

The first thing you want to do when starting a weekly layout is decide what is the most important thing for you to track and be aware of each week. For instance, I always have a box that has a list of all of the things I want to accomplish that week. Then I separate each to do into different days, ensuring  they're all scheduled to be done, but can also be moved to the next day if that specific "to-do" was not accomplished on that specific day. Below I posted a photo of six different weekly layouts that I used in my bullet journal last year.

Most weeks I use two pages for my weekly layouts but sometimes I only use one. Sometimes I have my food diary on my weekly pages, but other times I make an entirely new page for my food log. I found it extremely helpful this past summer/fall, when I was attempting to get back into good running shape, to look at the weather for the week ahead and plan what days I would run outside and when my rest days would be, based on the weather. However, if you live in an unpredictable climate location, like myself in Michigan, than you know there is only so much planning you can do around the weather. Sometimes I kept a gratitude tracker on each weekly page, but other times, like this month for instance, I used an entire page to track my gratitude for the whole month. I always try to track my water intake cause that's something I definitely struggle with, and am always trying to improve. I also quickly changed my habit tracker from being on my weekly pages to my monthly overview page, and I like that a lot more!


#### Let's get started!

The main idea behind weekly layouts is to conform it to your own needs. Maybe you're trying to save money so you track how much you spend each week. Or perhaps you want your weekly layouts to be designated only to appoinments, to-do's and plans for that week. That's great too! The layouts can always change week by week, and you can always change your needs from one week to the next as well. Below I'll show you how my layout has changed for the past four weeks in January based on my own needs and my likes, and dislikes from the previous week's layout.

This is my layout for the first week of January. This year I'm trying to save money and be more healthy. Therefore, I have a weekly spending tracker, sleep tracker and a daily water tracker. I also have a to-do's box for the current week, for the next week, and a box to keep track of necessary items to buy, like grocery items or shampoo.

This is for the second week of January. I started a food log this week to help remind myself to eat healthy, and to limit eating out. However, I didn't feel like I had enough room to write what I ate for each meal. I hate having to write small!

Here is the 3rd week of January. I made the food log longer, but not really bigger and I still struggled with room and having to write small. This was probably my least favorite week, in life, and with my layout (it was a longggg week). My to-do box was too long and short so I had to write small, with multiple columns, which I hate to do. I also apparantly made my spending box way too big, since I only filled in one line, so it looks really empty, which is good in real life, but annoying when I look at my pages. I haven't been happy with my water log area for the past 3 weeks. My goal is 100 oz. of water a day and I have a 20 oz. water bottle, so I only need 5 squares or circles to fill in, and what I had was just too long, so it always looked awkward, even if I happened to accomplished 100 oz. of water, which I never came close to doing (I'm telling you, it was a long week!).

Here is the fourth and final full week of January. I think this will definitely be my favorite weekly layout for this month, I think I worked out the kinks for a lot of my problems. I put my food log in each day instead of having it's own table. I made my water log like my sleep log, so it's more like a graph, which I think I'm going to love! I also think that my boxes for "To Do This Week", "Spending", "To Buy", and "To Do Next Week" will be about the right sizes for my needs. We shall see! I'll post my finished week on instagram **@journalsbyemily**, and let you know how it worked out for me.

There are many ways to do a weekly layout, but the important thing to remember, is ultimately your weekly layout is designed towards your specific wants and needs. Having everything you want to track and organize in each weekly layout is more important than having the most beautiful weekly layouts with the best design. Do not compare yourself to others when bullet journaling. If you are like me, you started bullet journaling to live a more organized and succesful lifestyle, not to win any artistic awards for doodles or calligraphy. Also, remember practice makes perfect! Just look at all of my weekly layouts from last year, compared to this year. There is quite a difference! 

Can anyone guess which layout was my very first layout from my first bullet journal? Comment on my instagram **@journalsbyemily** with your guesses!
