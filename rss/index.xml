<p>Welcome everyone! Today I&#8217;ll be discussing the basics to weekly layouts in your bullet journal. Personally, my weekly pages are the most important pages to me. They keep me organized and on track with my specific goals, especially goals that I may be tracking the overall progress of on a separate page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing you want to do when starting a weekly layout is decide what is the most important thing for you to track and be aware of each week. For instance, I always have a box that has a list of all of the things I want to accomplish that week. Then I separate each to do into different days, ensuring  they&#8217;re all scheduled to be done, but can also be moved to the next day if that specific "to-do" was not accomplished on that specific day. Below I posted a photo of six different weekly layouts that I used in my bullet journal last year.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most weeks I use two pages for my weekly layouts but sometimes I only use one. Sometimes I have my food diary on my weekly pages, but other times I make an entirely new page for my food log. I found it extremely helpful this past summer/fall, when I was attempting to get back into good running shape, to look at the weather for the week ahead and plan what days I would run outside and when my rest days would be, based on the weather. However, if you live in an unpredictable climate location, like myself in Michigan, than you know there is only so much planning you can do around the weather. Sometimes I kept a gratitude tracker on each weekly page, but other times, like this month for instance, I used an entire page to track my gratitude for the whole month. I always try to track my water intake cause that&#8217;s something I definitely struggle with, and am always trying to improve. I also quickly changed my habit tracker from being on my weekly pages to my monthly overview page, and I like that a lot more!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main idea behind weekly layouts is to conform it to your own needs. Maybe you&#8217;re trying to save money so you track how much you spend each week. Or perhaps you want your weekly layouts to be designated only to appoinments, to-do&#8217;s and plans for that week. That&#8217;s great too! The layouts can always change week by week, and you can always change your needs from one week to the next as well. Below I&#8217;ll show you how my layout has changed for the past four weeks in January based on my own needs and my likes, and dislikes from the previous week&#8217;s layout.</p>

<p>This is my layout for the first week of January. This year I&#8217;m trying to save money and be more healthy. Therefore, I have a weekly spending tracker, sleep tracker and a daily water tracker. I also have a to-do&#8217;s box for the current week, for the next week, and a box to keep track of necessary items to buy, like grocery items or shampoo.</p>

<p>This is for the second week of January. I started a food log this week to help remind myself to eat healthy, and to limit eating out. However, I didn&#8217;t feel like I had enough room to write what I ate for each meal. I hate having to write small!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the 3rd week of January. I made the food log longer, but not really bigger and I still struggled with room and having to write small. This was probably my least favorite week, in life, and with my layout (it was a longggg week). My to-do box was too long and short so I had to write small, with multiple columns, which I hate to do. I also apparantly made my spending box way too big, since I only filled in one line, so it looks really empty, which is good in real life, but annoying when I look at my pages. I haven&#8217;t been happy with my water log area for the past 3 weeks. My goal is 100 oz. of water a day and I have a 20 oz. water bottle, so I only need 5 squares or circles to fill in, and what I had was just too long, so it always looked awkward, even if I happened to accomplished 100 oz. of water, which I never came close to doing (I&#8217;m telling you, it was a long week!).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the fourth and final full week of January. I think this will definitely be my favorite weekly layout for this month, I think I worked out the kinks for a lot of my problems. I put my food log in each day instead of having it&#8217;s own table. I made my water log like my sleep log, so it&#8217;s more like a graph, which I think I&#8217;m going to love! I also think that my boxes for "To Do This Week", "Spending", "To Buy", and "To Do Next Week" will be about the right sizes for my needs. We shall see! I&#8217;ll post my finished week on instagram <strong>@journalsbyemily</strong>, and let you know how it worked out for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many ways to do a weekly layout, but the important thing to remember, is ultimately your weekly layout is designed towards your specific wants and needs. Having everything you want to track and organize in each weekly layout is more important than having the most beautiful weekly layouts with the best design. Do not compare yourself to others when bullet journaling. If you are like me, you started bullet journaling to live a more organized and succesful lifestyle, not to win any artistic awards for doodles or calligraphy. Also, remember practice makes perfect! Just look at all of my weekly layouts from last year, compared to this year. There is quite a difference!</p>

<p>Can anyone guess which layout was my very first layout from my first bullet journal? Comment on my instagram <strong>@journalsbyemily</strong> with your guesses!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Welcome to Journals by Emily. I&#8217;m a novice bullet journaler that loves beer, disney, corgis and organization. I caught onto the bullet journaling craze about 7 months ago in June of 2016. I&#8217;ve always been a pretty organized person, but I can tell you that having a bullet journal is a game-changer! I&#8217;m here to say that anyone and everyone who has a passion for living a more organized and structured life can be a bullet journaler.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the ultimate list of everything you need to start a bullet journal:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>a pen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a notebook</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>That&#8217;s it!</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Seriously, no joke, that is literally everything you need to have a successful bullet journal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are lots of extra things you can have to make your bullet journal more decorative or fancy, but really the only two things you need is any size notebook, and any kind of writing utensil.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I first started bullet journaling I went to Target and bought a blank moleskin sketchpad notebook. I wanted something without lines, because I know it would annoy me to see lines that weren&#8217;t being used in the actual layout. This is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Sketchbook-Large-Classic-Notebooks/dp/8883701151/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483927136&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=moleskine+sketchbook">first notebook</a> I used. It lasted me until the end of December, just in time to start a new one for the New Year. I liked the size of this notebook, it wasn&#8217;t too small but still fit in my purse easily, and the pages were thick enough, that there wasn&#8217;t any bleeding. However, any kind of spare notebook you have lying around will work; lined, blank, dotted, whatever, just something to write on!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Obviously, there are also many different kinds of pens out there that you can use as well. If you get really serious into bullet journaling you may want to later invest in nicer pens with different colors, but until then any pen, pencil, crayon, marker, etc. will work. I do highly recommend these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sharpie-Retractable-Point-Black-3-Count/dp/B002ONCFF4/ref=sr_1_4?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483928077&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=sharpie+pen">Sharpie Pens</a> that I discovered when I first started bullet journaling. They write nicely, have an awesome retractable top instead of a cap, and don&#8217;t bleed. They&#8217;re my favorite!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you have your supplies all your need to do is write. Write down what you want to organize, write down the days of the week with appointments and birthdays. Write down important dates that you can&#8217;t forget! Make lists of tv shows you want to watch. Make a list for your groceries. It doesn&#8217;t matter, anyway you decide to organize it, and anything you decide to organize is completely up to <strong>you</strong>!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The point is, anyone can have a bullet journal. It&#8217;s not as complicated as you may think. The great thing about bullet journals is it can keep you organzied in every manner of your life; work, home, fitness, and everything inbetween. Regular planners and agendas only deal with day to day life, but having your own customizable bullet journal can keep you organized in every single aspect of your life.</p>
